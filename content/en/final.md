## Individual Components
At the end of the development, I created two crafts, a belt and a lampshade decoration, using the twisted Chinese Knot.
There are two types of basic components:
One is the stable version, the other is the customizable version.

I also create four sub-patterns that can be inserted into the customizable components to decorate them. When we want to design a new pattern, we can print only the shape itself, not the whole component. This way we can save material and money on printing.
