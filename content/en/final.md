## Individual Components
At the end of development, I created two crafts, a belt and a lampshade decoration, using the twisted Chinese Knot.
Here are two types of basic components:
One is the stable version, the other is customizable version.

Also I create four sub-patterns which can be inserted in the cusomizable components to decorate it. If we want to design a new pattern, we can only print out the shape itself but not the whole component. Through this way, we can save materials and money from printing.
