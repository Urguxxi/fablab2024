## New Patterns
As I mentioned last week, I would design more patterns to make the compoents more customizable. So I designed 3 more patterns this week. I got the patterns from curricular operation.
The inspiration is from flowers and clovers.

Also I printed some black patterns to add more flavors.

## New Component -- Buckle
Regarding the idea of assembling a belt, I think a buckle for the belt is necessary to make it easy to put on and take off. So I cut the original component and added a large arrow to give the effect of a buckle.

But there are still some minor problems here. The arrow is not long enough to make the connection stable, and the head of arrow is not big enough either.

## Future Work
- Design more patterns if possible
- Improve the design of the buckle
- Massive printing
