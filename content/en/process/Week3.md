## New Shape
I realized that the original Chinese Knot shape is better to be individual rather than assembled together, as there will be large holes between the pieces:

So they are not compact enough.

I decided to cut off the ears of the knot to make a more compact structure and the new version really work better than the former ones.

## Innovate
Now the pieces can be assembled into different structures but for me they're still simple and basic. Then I recalled that we're asked to use PHA instead of PLA as PHA is biodegradable and more sustainable. So why not do something more environmentally friendly?

I looked into the structure of the new piece and found a part of it could be removed. It occurred to me that I could take that part out and print some sub-components to decorate the whole pattern. Thus the pattern would be customizable as well as more environmentally friendly as less materials would be used to print it.

I just designed a new sub-pattern as an eye, and more new patterns would come later.

## Assemble
I printed more basic components and tried to assemble them and it went well. The body is flat, foldable and parametric. Also the sub-pattern is a plus for the design.

## Future Work
- Design more sub-patterns
- Improve the connections between the pieces
- Print more components to assemble a complete object
