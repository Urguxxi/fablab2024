## Assemble

This week I finished printing all the pieces I need and started assembling the final piece.

First I assembled the basic patterns together to create the shape of a belt.

Then I inserted the buckle of belt to close the belt to get 3D version.

Now we could put on the sub-patterns to decorate the belt.(I put on all types of sub-patterns to showcase them, but in general it's not good to put on all of them)

I also printed some extra pieces to make something else, and I got a decoration to wrap around the lamp, so there is a possibility to make a lot of different shapes with my basic patterns.
