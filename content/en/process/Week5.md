## New Buckles

I changed the size of the arrows on the buckles to make them more stable. I also changed the thickness of the arrows to be the same as the thickness of the whole components to avoid any accident from the printer.

Now they work better than before.

## Next Step
- To assemble the components into a whole belt.
